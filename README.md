# Titanic-Machine-Learning-Model
An introductory project to begin machine learning and gain practical experience


The use of pandas and regression learning to train machine learning to predict two catagories:
  the first catagory is the prediction of survival of the passengers on board of the titanic,
  The second is the prediction of the sex of the passengers based on the given data
  
The following libraries were used:
  operator,
  matplotlib,
  numpy,
  pyparsing, 
  sklearn.linear_model,
  sklearn.metrics,
  pandas,
  re,
  seaborn,
  math
